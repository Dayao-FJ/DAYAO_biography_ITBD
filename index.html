    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b><sup>1</sup></b>I am Francis Janrielle Dimaya Dayao, a 20-year-old Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at the University of the East-Manila.
      <b><sup>2</sup></b> I was born on January 4, 2005, to my loving parents, Mr. Jefferson Francisco Dayao (48) and Mrs. Floriza Dimaya Dayao (46).
      <b><sup>3</sup></b> I also have a younger sister named Frinchez Jhefferdine Dimaya Dayao (14).
      <b><sup>4</sup></b> I grew up in Brgy. Entablado, Cabiao, Nueva Ecija, where I lived before moving to Manila for college.
      <b><sup>5</sup></b> My family is very close to our relatives, especially on  my father's side, since we spent most of our time with them.
      <b><sup>6</sup></b> This is because our home is where my father grew up. 
      <b><sup>7</sup></b> However, it is a family tradition to spend Christmas with my mother's side, during which we celebrate the Dimaya Family Reunion.
      <b><sup>8</sup></b> This tradition has allowed me to build connections with relatives I only get to see during the holidays.
      <b><sup>9</sup></b> As I grew older, I became close to my cousins from both sides of the family, treating them like siblings.
      <b><sup>10</sup></b> As a child, I dreamed of becoming an engineer, just like many other kids.
      <b><sup>11</sup></b> This was largely due to my interest in building things with Legos and sand.
      <b><sup>12</sup></b> This interest sparked my love for drawing, leading me to compete in poster-making contests.
      <b><sup>13</sup></b> I was the type of child who often broke the rules, choosing to play outside and interact with other kids.
      <b><sup>14</sup></b> I frequently got scolded for sneaking out of the house and coming home covered in dirt.
      <b><sup>15</sup></b> These incidents made me fear getting my clothes dirty because my mother would discipline me with a broom or a belt.
      <b><sup>16</sup></b> Because of this, I grew up valuing cleanliness and maintaining a tidy environment.
      <b><sup>17</sup></b> During my elementary years, I often competed for the top ranks in my class because my mother encouraged me to aim for excellence.
      <b><sup>18</sup></b> When I was in first grade, I competed in a mathematics tournament but did not place.
      <b><sup>19</sup></b> However, I was recognized as the second top student in my section, which motivated me to keep striving for success.
      <b><sup>20</sup></b> In second grade, competition became tougher, and I faced bullying, which made school challenging.
      <b><sup>21</sup></b> I struggled to keep up with new classmates who were more academically advanced than me.
      <b><sup>22</sup></b> Additionally, the bullying led to two visits to the principal's office that year.
      <b><sup>23</sup></b> Despite these difficulties, I still managed to rank third in my class.
      <b><sup>24</sup></b> When I reached third grade, a major challenge arose—my mother decided to work abroad as a domestic helper.
      <b><sup>25</sup></b> She had always been my biggest source of support and motivation in school.
      <b><sup>26</sup></b> That year, I competed in a science quiz and placed second but failed to advance to the next level.
      <b><sup>27</sup></b> Despite this setback, I was recognized as the second top student in my class, making my mother proud.
      <b><sup>28</sup></b> In fourth grade, I had to adjust to life without my mother’s presence.
      <b><sup>29</sup></b> However, I took this opportunity to explore new skills and joined my beloved journalism club.
      <b><sup>30</sup></b> Since then, I have loved writing news and drawing editorial cartoons.
      <b><sup>31</sup></b> My first roles were as a news writer and editorial writer, but my anxiety held me back from winning any awards.
      <b><sup>32</sup></b> I ranked fourth in my class that year.
      <b><sup>33</sup></b> My passion for journalism continued in fifth grade, where I competed in multiple contests as an editorial cartoonist and sports writer.
      <b><sup>34</sup></b> Juggling two categories was difficult, but I still managed to place sixth in editorial cartooning.
      <b><sup>35</sup></b> However, I dropped to seventh place in my class rankings.
      <b><sup>36</sup></b> During my final year in elementary school, I realized how much my mother’s absence had impacted my academic performance.
      <b><sup>37</sup></b> Since she left, I had struggled to maintain my standing in school.
      <b><sup>38</sup></b> Despite this, I continued competing in various contests, including mathematics, science, and journalism, which divided my focus.
      <b><sup>39</sup></b> I graduated as the 16th top student in the Entablado Elementary School Batch 2015-2016.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b><sup>1</sup></b>When I turned in a teenager, I moved on to Cabiao National High School, where I initially felt alone.
      <b><sup>2</sup></b> I was no longer a candidate for the top ranks, but I remained in the first section, proving that I was still academically capable.
      <b><sup>3</sup></b> To my surprise, my love for journalism continued into high school.
      <b><sup>4</sup></b> I became part of the Collaborative Online Publishing team, competing against other high schools in Nueva Ecija.
      <b><sup>5</sup></b> Our team, composed only of first- and second-year students, trained for just a month and competed against senior students from other schools.
      <b><sup>6</sup></b> Despite the odds, we finished in fourth place, which motivated us to work even harder for the following year's competition.
      <b><sup>7</sup></b> During my third year, an unfortunate event struck our team.
      <b><sup>8</sup></b> As we competed, our internet connection slowed down, preventing us from finishing on time.
      <b><sup>9</sup></b> I remember crying in frustration, but this experience taught me that bad days happen, and we must learn to deal with them.
      <b><sup>10</sup></b> Sadly, our competitions came to a halt when COVID-19 spread across the world.
      <b><sup>11</sup></b> The pandemic was the worst period of my life, as we were all stuck at home with nothing to do.
      <b><sup>12</sup></b> To pass the time, I got hooked on anime and gaming, as I could no longer go outside for entertainment.
      <b><sup>13</sup></b> Anime helped lift my spirits and brought me joy during those melancholic days.
      <b><sup>14</sup></b> When classes resumed through modular and online learning, I found myself learning how to cook instead of focusing on ICT, which was my field of interest.
      <b><sup>15</sup></b> I graduated as part of the Batch 2019-2020, but we missed the chance to walk the stage since our graduation was held online.
      <b><sup>16</sup></b> During my 12th grade, I shifted into face-t-face classes, giving me time to spend with my friends and it provided easy way to study.
      <b><sup>17</sup></b> I love learning Physics and Biology as it became my favorite subjects to learn.
      <b><sup>18</sup></b> I graduated from Cabiao Senior High School in 2021-2022, achieving several milestones.
      <b><sup>19</sup></b> One of my notable accomplishments was becoming the P.I.O. Officer of the Youth for the Environment in Schools Organization (YES-O).
      <b><sup>20</sup></b> Additionally, I was wellknown as a STEM student.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b><sup>1</sup></b>Currently, I am a second-year BSIT student at the University of the East-Manila.
      <b><sup>2</sup></b> I couldn’t believe that even in college, my love for journalism continues as I had an opportunity to be part of the official student publication of UE, UE Dawn.
      <b><sup>3</sup></b> I became a junior sports writer during my first year of college.
      <b><sup>4</sup></b> I experienced to go in venues of sport events such as the Shakey’s Volleyball Tournament where I first wrote my very first sports news for the Red Warriors.
      <b><sup>5</sup></b> I can still remember that despite the loss that the UE Lady Warriors received against the NU Lady Bulldogs, on the way back to UE, the bus is filled with joy and excitement as they see it as excitement for the upcoming UAAP Season 86 Volleyball Tournament.
      <b><sup>6</sup></b> I also covered multiple games of the UE men’s basketball team, meeting new athletes to be friends with.
      <b><sup>7</sup></b> I also tried to became a photographer and took shots for our news report that I also wrote.
      <b><sup>8</sup></b> I was inspired by my seniors to thrive and work hard to accomplish many things as a Warrior.
      <b><sup>9</sup></b> The best experience as a journalist was the day where I covered a sports event from 9 A.M. until 12 P.M.
      <b><sup>10</sup></b> It was a very exhausting day but it encouraged me that I can do anything if I put my heart into it.
      <b><sup>11</sup></b> It was a volleyball game for both men’s and women’s game.
      <b><sup>12</sup></b> It was an awesome experience especially that after a win in their opening game, the UE women’s volleyball team coach is kind enough to include as on their celebratory dinner at Mang Inasal.
      <b><sup>13</sup></b> Despite loving the experience, I decided to resign as a senior sports writer on December 2024.
      <b><sup>14</sup></b> It was a hard decision for me; however, the decision has been made so that I could prioritize and focus on my study.
      <b><sup>15</sup></b> I receive a very unexpected low grades and been sad ever since, I planned to resign so that my focus is solely to my studies.
      <b><sup>16</sup></b> Now, I am getting used to not being with my seniors in the UE Dawn but they are still kind enough to greet me and still be in touch with me.
      <b><sup>17</sup></b> As I continue to be a student, I am currently having a great time in focusing in my studies as I have a lot of time for my self and to study.
      <b><sup>18</sup></b> I only build a new hobby of reading books that made me calm and forget the school works that brings stress to me.
      <b><sup>19</sup></b> Books makes me calm and specially the books of Arthur Conan Doyle, “Sherlock Holmes”.
      <b><sup>20</sup></b> I may not be a writer now, but surely I keep in touch with my love for journalist as I support and read news articles.
